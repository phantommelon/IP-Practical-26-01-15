<center><h1>IP/PDS: Using Inheritance - 
Lecture company</h1></center>



<h2>Scenario</h2>

A Company has a number of employees and shareholders. These people
earn money from the company through salaries, share dividends or both.  


The company has a number of types of employees, namely 
<ul>
<li>Directors </li>
<li>Engineers</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Temporary staff.</li>
</ul>


 Every employee has an employee
number and personal details, such as their name and address.  



<h2>Permanent Staff</h2>


The Directors of the company sit on the board and manage the company.


The Engineers build the products. They have a basic monthly
salary. However, they are often required to work overtime and they
receive a fixed hourly rate for any overtime hours done each month.  



The sales staff sell the company's products and can earn commission on
top of their basic monthly salary, depending on their sales
performance. To earn commission they have to surpass the company sales
target of 2500 units per month. 




<h2>Temporary Staff</h2>


The company also employs a number of temporary staff. These do not
have permanent contracts, instead they have a fixed deadline when
their contract terminates.

 The temporary staff are split into two
groups, those that are paid weekly and those that are paid
monthly. Those that are paid monthly can do overtime. 



<h2>Shareholders</h2>

<ul>
<li>Shareholders have a number of shares in the company and earn a
dividend on these shares.</li>
<li> Each shareholder also has personal details,
such as their name and address.</li>
<li>Shareholders can also be employees.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Reports</h2>
The company needs to be able to list its employees and shareholders:
<pre>Name: Fred Bloggs
Address: 14 Medlock Drive
Employee Number: 5067
Temporary Staff
  - Contract terminates 31/03/04
Paid Weekly
Worked 20 hours
</pre>


The company needs to be able to calculate the pay of each employee and
the share dividend for the shareholders:
<pre>Surname:
First Name(s):
Employee Number:
Payment Due:	(Per Week/ Per Month)
</pre>


<h2>Task</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identify the classes (nouns), fields (adjectives/properties) and methods (verbs) in this scenario.</li>
<li> Use this to design classes, taking care to note any possible inheritance relationships between classes.</li>
</ul>
